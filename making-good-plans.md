# Making Good Plans

This is a guide to help in making good plans. It contains potential questions, development caveats, and otherwise helpful ideas that could contribute to making a better plan.

## Questions to Ask

- [] Ask what buttons do
  - What are the actions of buttons
  - Where do links lead
- [] What pieces of this are similar to other functionality?
  - Is there any styles that exist that we can call?
  - Is there a module that we can implement?
- [] What classes might we need to extend?
- [] Might we need to confer with design?

## Tips

- Overestimate amounts, by _a lot_
  - Skill & questions that arise during the build take time, we want to account for large amounts of communication during the task at hand
