# Cole's Wiki

This is my notes wiki that is to be populated with helpful tips/commands/ideas that I am going to reference & keep up to date over the course of my dev journey! ðŸ’™

`/documentation` documents processes that are repeated based on a checklist or list of steps whereas `/main` holds general notes and is populated by topic. Finally `/courses` holds notes on courses that I have taken and `/archive` are notes that aren't useful anymore.

Most of this won't be useful for everyone so I suggest taking a look at my website [colegeerts.com](https://colegeerts.com/) for actually interesting content.
